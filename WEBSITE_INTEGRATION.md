**Key Functions**:
```typescript
// Main analysis function
const analyzeWebsite = async (websiteUrl: string): Promise<WebsiteInsights>

// URL validation and normalization
const handleAnalyze = async ()
```

### 2. WebsiteInsightsDashboard Component

## Data Structure

### WebsiteInsights Interface
```typescript
interface WebsiteInsights {
  url: string;
  title: string;
  status: "online" | "offline" | "slow";
  loadTime: number;
  pageViews: number;
  uniqueVisitors: number;
  bounceRate: number;
  avgSessionDuration: string;
  topPages: { page: string; views: number }[];
  trafficSources: { source: string; percentage: number }[];
  performanceScore: number;
  seoScore: number;
  lastUpdated: string;
}
```

## Mock Data Generation

The feature uses intelligent mock data generation that:

1. **Validates URLs** using JavaScript's URL constructor
2. **Extracts domain names** for realistic website titles
3. **Generates realistic metrics** with appropriate ranges:
   - Page views: 10,000 - 60,000
   - Unique visitors: 5,000 - 30,000
   - Bounce rate: 30% - 70%
   - Performance scores: 70-100
   - Load times: 0.5s - 3.5s

4. **Creates realistic traffic sources**:
   - Organic Search (40-70%)
   - Direct Traffic (20-40%)
   - Social Media (10-25%)
   - Referral Traffic (5-15%)

## User Flow

1. **URL Input**: User enters a website URL in the input field
2. **Validation**: System validates the URL format
3. **Analysis**: 2-second simulation of website analysis
4. **Results Display**: Comprehensive dashboard with:
   - Website status and basic info
   - Key performance metrics
   - Performance and SEO scores
   - Top pages breakdown
   - Traffic source analysis

## Integration with Main Dashboard

The website integration is seamlessly integrated into the main dashboard:

```typescript
// Main dashboard state management
const [websiteInsights, setWebsiteInsights] = useState<WebsiteInsights | null>(null);

// Callback when website is analyzed
const handleWebsiteAnalyzed = (insights: WebsiteInsights) => {
  setWebsiteInsights(insights);
};

// Conditional rendering of insights dashboard
{websiteInsights && (
  <WebsiteInsightsDashboard insights={websiteInsights} />
)}
```

## Real-World Implementation Notes

In a production environment, this feature would integrate with:

1. **Google Analytics API** for traffic data
2. **PageSpeed Insights API** for performance metrics
3. **Google Search Console API** for SEO data
4. **Web scraping services** for basic website information
5. **Third-party analytics platforms** like Mixpanel, Hotjar, etc.

## Technical Highlights

- Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces
- Proper error handling and validation
- Type-safe prop passing between components

### Performance Optimizations
- Debounced analysis calls
- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
- Optimized chart rendering with Recharts

- Screen reader friendly content
- High contrast color schemes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this feature:

1. **Real API Integration**: Connect to actual analytics services
2. **Historical Data**: Show trends over time
3. **Comparison Mode**: Compare multiple websites
4. **Custom Metrics**: Allow users to define custom KPIs
5. **Export Reports**: Generate PDF/Excel reports for websites
6. **Alerts & Monitoring**: Set up performance alerts
7. **Competitor Analysis**: Compare against industry benchmarks

## Testing the Feature

To test the website integration:

1. **Manual URL Entry**: Type any valid URL (e.g., `google.com`, `https://github.com`)
2. **Quick Demo**: Use the pre-configured website buttons
3. **Error Testing**: Try invalid URLs to see error handling
4. **Responsive Testing**: Check on different screen sizes
5. **Theme Testing**: Switch between dark/light modes

The feature demonstrates a complete end-to-end website analysis workflow with professional UI/UX design and comprehensive data visualization.
